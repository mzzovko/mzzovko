I am a programmer currently interested in the intersection of systems-level programming, cybersecurity, and AI. 

Until 2022, I predominantly worked as a full-stack web developer. My main skills are in Go and React+Typescript. During that time, I have led and created projects in the natural gas pipeline and travel tech industry. I used to work a lot with PHP and Javascript wilderness, but well, it's time to move on. Currently I'm mostly using Jai or Go.
