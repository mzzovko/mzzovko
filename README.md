I am a programmer currently interested in the intersection of 
systems-level programming, cybersecurity and AI. 

Until 2022, I predominantly worked as a full-stack web developer. My main 
skills are in Go and React+Typescript. During that time, I have led and 
created projects in the natural gas pipeline industry and travel tech. I 
used to work a lot with PHP and Javascript wilderness, but well, it's time 
to move on. Currently I'm mostly using Jai.
